Hi, I'm Xiaowei Liu(刘晓伟) from ISCAS(UCAS).  
You can get in touch with me by [Email](mailto:liu_xiaowei@foxmail.com) or [Github](https://github.com/lxw0109).

## IT skills
My favourite programming language is Python, whose simplicity and powerfulness fascinates me. Besides, I'm interested in Computer Network, Linux, and Web Spider.
My resume in [Chinese](/resume_zh/) and [English](/resume_zh/).

## Sports
I love swimming very much. And I like badminton and basketball as well.

## Reading
Besides technical books, I love reading detective novels, especially those written by [Keigo Higashino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keigo_Higashino). You can find my reading list [here](http://xiaoweiliu.cn/2016/08/08/Keigo-Higashino/).

BTW, my original blog is on [cnblogs](http://www.cnblogs.com/lxw0109).
